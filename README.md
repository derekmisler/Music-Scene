This was an Angular app, initially built to overcome limitations in an old CMS, that eventually became this: http://www.exploreasheville.com/iconic-asheville/music-heritage/. It pulls editorial content into the randomly-sorted widgets. The design of the widgets eventually became the inspiration for the widgets in the new ExploreAsheville.com. The sorting was done using the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle (found here: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/).
